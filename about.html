    <p class="centertext"><em>architect and interdisciplinary PhD researcher at KULeuven</em></p>
    <p>
        Weronika Gajda is an interdisciplinary PhD researcher at the Faculties of Architecture and Engineering Technology at KU Leuven in Gent. 
        Before her master's studies, she worked as an architect at medusagroup in Poland. She is now affiliated with the Architecture & Wicked 
        Matters, Geomatics, and DRAMCO research groups. Her research project, "Citography", which evolved from her master thesis in Fieldstation 
        studio at KU Leuven, investigates how digital media ecologies influence urban living and design. By adopting an interdisciplinary 
        approach, Weronika integrates insights from both engineering and architecture to better understand how digital technologies are interwoven
        into the design of urban environments. In her mapping practice, she develops the "Citographer Toolkit", which includes tempo-spatial 
        modeling with Blender, sensing tools design, and data acquisition techniques. This toolkit facilitates a more profound exploration 
        of how these technologies shape the experience and design of public spaces. Throughout her PhD, Weronika teaches a mapping elective 
        titled 'Citography' to architecture students, disseminating the tools and techniques she continuously refines in her research.
